    - Desktop sticky sidebar that doesn't overlap content
    - Automatic sheet closing on route changes (browser back/forward support)
    - Sidebar links properly close drawer on navigation
  - **Dashboard Responsiveness** (âœ… Complete for Index and MaterialManager):
    - Grid layouts: 1 column mobile â†’ 2 columns tablet â†’ 4 columns desktop

  - **Feature Added**: Created dedicated materials management dashboard for Gestor de Material role
  - **Files Created**: `src/pages/material-manager/Dashboard.tsx`

  - **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and screen reader support included
- âœ… **Task Management - Employee Assignment Fix**:
  - **Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved issue where task creation modal couldn't load assigned employees for events
  - **Root Cause**: Function was querying non-existent `event_employees` table instead of using the roster JSONB field
  - **Solution**: Rewrote `loadAssigneesByEvent()` in `src/utils/taskUtils.ts` to correctly fetch from `events.roster` JSONB field
  - **Functionality**: 
    - When no event selected: Shows all employees from `employees` table
    - When event selected: Extracts teamLead + teamMembers from roster JSONB and fetches their details
    - Handles edge cases: Empty roster, missing event, no assignments
  - **Data Structure**: Roster stores `{ teamLead: "uuid", teamMembers: [{ id, name, role }], materials: {} }`
  - **Testing**: Manual test scenarios created for events with/without rosters
