- ✅ **Gestor de Material Sidebar Enhancement**:
  - **Feature Added**: Added "Materiais" and "Requisições" links to Gestor de Material sidebar navigation
  - **Files Modified**: `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
  - **Navigation Items**: Dashboard, Calendário, Escalações, Materiais, Requisições

    - Form validation and error handling
    - Loading states and user feedback
  - **Authorization**: Properly configured hasPermission checks for route access
- ✅ **Logout Button Implementation & Fix**:
  - **Feature Added**: Global logout button added to all role pages (Admin, Técnico, Financeiro, etc.)
  - **Location**: Button placed next to notification bell icon in Header component
  - **Bug Fix**: Resolved logout button not working issue
    - **Root Cause**: Logout function wasn't clearing session/user states manually, causing timing issues
    - **Solution**: Updated AuthContext to manually clear states after signOut and added error handling
  - **Functionality**: 
    - Calls Supabase auth.signOut() and clears local states
    - Redirects user to /login page after logout (even if logout fails for better UX)
    - Works across all authenticated pages via shared DashboardLayout
  - **Components Modified**: `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
  - **Error Handling**: Added try/catch blocks and error logging for debugging
  - **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and screen reader support included
- ✅ **Task Management - Employee Assignment Fix**:
  - **Critical Bug Fix**: Resolved issue where task creation modal couldn't load assigned employees for events
  - **Root Cause**: Function was querying non-existent `event_employees` table instead of using the roster JSONB field
  - **Solution**: Rewrote `loadAssigneesByEvent()` in `src/utils/taskUtils.ts` to correctly fetch from `events.roster` JSONB field
  - **Functionality**: 
    - When no event selected: Shows all employees from `employees` table
    - When event selected: Extracts teamLead + teamMembers from roster JSONB and fetches their details
    - Handles edge cases: Empty roster, missing event, no assignments
  - **Data Structure**: Roster stores `{ teamLead: "uuid", teamMembers: [{ id, name, role }], materials: {} }`
  - **Testing**: Manual test scenarios created for events with/without rosters
